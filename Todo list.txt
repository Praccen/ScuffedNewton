----Essentials----
- Mesh-mesh collision using SAT and possible speedups.
- Collision manifolds
- Dynamic rigid body collisions
- Take movement into consideration when updating broad phase octree.
- Fix "sticky" collisions where the intersection axis is pointing the wrong way. Happens on corners. Also gets stuck on the middle line of a quad sometimes
- Multi-thread stuff
------------------

----Improvements possible----
- Keep a list of all current collisions, double check those every frame instead of going into static collision check. Should make it possible to use only continous collision pass.
- Find which bounding boxes / objects are colliding first in continous collisions before going into triangles.
- Replace glm::dot's with Intersection::dot's. Also see if implementing own version of cross, normalize etc is faster than glm.
- Replace [] indexing with iterators
- Make interface pretty and user friendly
- Make it possible to render bounding boxes in some way
- Add support for multiple meshes in the mesh component / mesh class.
- Add inverse matrix multiplication for ray intersections instead of multiplying every vertex of a mesh with the model matrix
- Add support for Spheres
- Add support for Capsules
- Add option for left or right handed triangles
- Remove prepareCorners?? (Done in the beginning of many systems)
-----------------------------

----Done :D----
- Do inverse model matrix multiplications for AABB instead of multiplying every vertex by the model matrix (might have to implement other than AABB-triangle for this since inverse model matrix multiplication might scew AABB to other shape)
- Add support for OBB's
- General SAT solution for collisions
- Continous collision detection using SAT instead of swept sphere
- Narrow phase hierarchy
