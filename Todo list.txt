- Narrow phase hierarchy (octree)
- Mesh-mesh collision using SAT and possible speedups.
- Continous collision detection using SAT instead of swept sphere
- Dynamic rigid body collisions (Remove ragdoll component)
- Add support for OBB's
- Add support for Bounding spheres
- Add support for Capsules
- Make interface pretty and user friendly
- Make it possible to render bounding boxes in some way
- Replace glm::dot's with Intersection::dot's. Also see if implementing own version of cross, normalize etc is faster than glm.


--Done :D--
- Do inverse model matrix multiplications for AABB instead of multiplying every vertex by the model matrix (might have to implement other than AABB-triangle for this since inverse model matrix multiplication might scew AABB to other shape)
