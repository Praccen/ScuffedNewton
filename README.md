# ScuffedNewton
A kind of wonky physics engine in development

The physics engine is compiled as a DLL for easy usage. 
So far Scuffed Newton is mostly a component based collision engine that uses Separating Axis Theorem to find collisions (including continous collisions) and provides very simple collision response. However, most of the detection part is there (like collision manifolds etc) to start implementing everything needed for dynamic rigidbody collisions.
